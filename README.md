# LeetShare ??

Welcome to LeetShare, the ultimate tool for coding warriors who collaborate on conquering Leetcode challenges together! ???

## What is LeetShare? ??

LeetShare is a nifty Chrome extension designed for folks sharing premium Leetcode accounts to manage their sessions like a pro. It cleverly intercepts any code submissions and swiftly switches to your personal session right before the submission hits the server. This means your streaks, solutions, and progress stay yours, no matter who else is logged into the account. No more session mix-ups when your buddy decides to tackle a binary tree at the same time as you're sorting arrays! ?? ?? ??

## Why Not Manifest V3? ?????

We're rolling with `manifest_version: 2` because, honestly, V3 was a pain to work with (and might get the axe later this year ??). So we're keeping it old school for the sake of simplicity and sanity. V2's got our back and hopefully yours too!

## Getting Started ??

Wanna get LeetShare up and running? Follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP of our project.
2. Unzip (if you downloaded the ZIP) and navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your favorite Chromium-based browser.
3. Enable `Developer mode` at the top right corner. (Yep, feel like a hacker! ?????)
4. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the directory where you've got LeetShare chilling.
5. Voilˆ! The extension should now be part of your browser squad, ready to guard your sessions.

## Friendly Reminder ??

LeetShare is meant to be a fair use tool for educational purposes. Please ensure you're abiding by Leetcode's terms of use and not violating any rules. Play nice, code right, and happy Leetcoding! ??????????

Remember, LeetShare is all about keeping your coding flow smooth and personal, even when sharing. So share the load, not the code! ??

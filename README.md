## About 📖

LeetShare is a nifty tool for tech enthusiasts who have to manage multiple profiles. It's all fun and games until you realize that using the same account on multiple devices messes with different sessions. That's where LeetShare comes in! This extension is your behind-the-scenes hero, ensuring that when you hit that submit button, it's device's specific session that gets the credit, not your neighbour's dog's iPad you also happened to be logged into. Say goodbye to the frustration of session mix-ups and hello to seamless coding sessions. Whether you're tackling daily challenges or grinding through interview prep, LeetShare keeps your focus on the code, not the logistics.

##  How it works? 🛠️

This extension works by storing your Leetcode session ID in your browser's local storage. That way upon sending,

When you switch profiles, the extension automatically updates the session data. And before you submit your code, the extension ensures that the correct session is selected and your submission is sent from the right profile.
